        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Birth and Family:</strong>
            Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, in Röcken, a small village in Germany. His father, a Lutheran pastor, passed away when Nietzsche was just five years old. Nietzsche's family played an important role in his early education, and despite his early loss, he was encouraged to pursue higher education.</p>
        <p><strong>Education and Academic Career:</strong>
            Nietzsche showed great academic promise from a young age. He studied classical philology (ancient Greek and Roman literature) at the University of Leipzig, and later became a professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland in 1869, at the remarkably young age of 24. However, his academic career was cut short due to his ongoing health problems. In 1879, he was forced to resign from his post due to his deteriorating physical and mental health.</p>
        <p><strong>Development of Philosophical Ideas:</strong>
            Nietzsche’s early work focused on the rejection of traditional Christian values and the exploration of individual freedom and morality. His most famous idea, “God is dead,” challenged the authority of religion in the modern world, arguing that traditional moral values had lost their relevance in the absence of a divine order. His ideas led to the development of nihilism, the belief that life lacks inherent meaning.</p>
        <p><strong>Übermensch and Will to Power:</strong>
            A central theme in Nietzsche's philosophy is the idea of the Übermensch, or Overman. This concept represents an individual who transcends traditional values and creates their own meaning in life. Nietzsche believed that the "Übermensch" embodies the potential of human beings to rise above the constraints of conventional morality and live authentically. Nietzsche also introduced the concept of the Will to Power, which argues that the fundamental driving force of life is not survival, but the desire for power, growth, and creativity.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Problems and Decline:</strong>
            Nietzsche struggled with severe health problems throughout his life, including intense headaches, vision issues, and mental health challenges. These problems worsened over time, leading to a breakdown in 1889 when Nietzsche suffered a complete mental collapse. Following this, he spent the rest of his life in the care of his mother and later his sister, living in isolation in Switzerland.</p>
        <p><strong>Death and Legacy:</strong>
            Nietzsche died on August 25, 1900, from complications of a stroke at the age of 55. After his death, his ideas gained widespread influence, especially in the fields of philosophy, psychology, literature, and the arts. However, his work was misinterpreted and even appropriated by ideologies such as Nazism, though Nietzsche himself was opposed to nationalism, anti-Semitism, and totalitarianism.</p>
